## Basic knowledge about our project
### Cells (tế bào)
A cell is a basic, structural unit of all life forms.  
There are **2** types of cells: **Prokaryotic cells** *(tế bào nhân sơ)* and **Eukaryotic cells** *(tế bào nhân thực)*.  
The 2 types differ by the completeness of **nuclei** *(nhân tế bào)*.  
### Cell cycle (chu kỳ tế bào)
A cell cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell that cause it to divide into **two daughter cells**.  
For **eukaryotes**, a cell cycle includes:
- Resting phase G0: where the cell left the cycle and stop dividing.
- Interphase with 3 phases:
	+ G1: Collecting materials for DNA replication.
	+ S: Where DNA replication occurs.
	+ G2: Cell growth and collecting materials for **mitosis**.
- Mitosis phase M: the process in which the **chromosomes** *(nhiễm sắc thể)* in the cell **nucleus** were seperated into two identical sets. Immediately, **cytokinesis** *(phân chia tế bào chất)* follows, resulting into two identical daughter cells. *(Mitosis is one of our study field of this project)*
### Types of cell division (phân bào)
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides, when a mother cell divides into two or more daughter cells.
#### Binary fission/ amitosis/ direct cell division (trực phân)
Amitosis occurs in **prokaryotic cells**, with the stages as below:

#### Mitosis (nguyên phân)
Mitosis occurs in **eukaryotic cells**, with the stages as below:

#### Meiosis (giảm phân)
Meiosis is a special type of cell division, which only occurs in **eukaryotic cells**, specifically **reproductive cells** *(tế bào sinh dục)*, for example sperm or egg cells. Below are the stages of meiosis:
